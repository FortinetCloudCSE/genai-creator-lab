# Welcome to this hands-on machine learning lab!

## In this lab you will

- Work with real-world email spam data  
- Build your own **Transformer-based NLP model**  
- Train a classifier using deep learning  
- Evaluate the performance of your model  
- Understand each step of the ML pipeline  
- Run live inference on user-provided text inputs  

## What This Lab Covers—and What It Does Not

- This lab focuses on supervised machine learning.
- The model produces deterministic predictions.
- The objective is classification accuracy, not text generation.
- Generative models and LLMs are covered in a separate advanced lab.

## Learning Goals
By the end of this lab you will be able to:

- Explain how text datasets are prepared for machine learning  
- Vectorize and tokenize text inputs  
- Implement a Transformer encoder block  
- Train a binary classification model  
- Understand accuracy, AUC, confusion matrices  
- Save and reload ML models  
- Use a model for real-world predictions
