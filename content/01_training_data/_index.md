In this chapter you will prepare and vectorize the data on which the machine learning model will get trainined on. As not every data set looks the same, you will have to understand the structure of the data first, format it to fit the requirements of the framework and vectorize the data.

**Chapters:**
- [Prepare training, validation & test data](load_and_split.md)
- [Vectorize the Training Data](vectorization.md)
- [Optimize the Dataset](optimize_data.md)
